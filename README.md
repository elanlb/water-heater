# water-heater
This is a webapp running on a Raspberry Pi to preheat the water in the house. It uses an HTML page with a simple script to either activate or deactivate the pump which circulates hot water throughout the pipes.

## Installation
Set up the Raspberry Pi as needed, then run `./configure.sh`.
